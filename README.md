# K-pop Popularity Analysis: Impact of Martial Law

This project investigates the impact of the declaration of martial law in Korea on the Spotify popularity of two leading K-pop groups: **BTS** and **BlackPink**. Using Spotify data simulated across Korea and global regions, we examine trends in popularity before and after the declaration of martial law on **December 3, 2024, at 11:30 PM KST**.

## Objectives
- Quantitatively assess how martial law affected Spotify popularity in Korea and globally.
- Identify trends and patterns in K-pop popularity for BTS and BlackPink.
- Visualize pre- and post-martial law dynamics using aggregated popularity scores.

## Methodology
1. **Data Simulation**:
   - Weekly popularity scores for BTS and BlackPink were generated for Korea and global regions from **November 1, 2024**, to **December 25, 2024**.
   - Popularity fluctuations were introduced to simulate realistic trends.

2. **Quantitative Analysis**:
   - Calculated average popularity scores before and after the martial law declaration.
   - Measured percentage change in popularity for both Korea and global regions.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Created line charts to illustrate popularity trends over time.
   - Bar charts to display percentage changes pre- and post-martial law.

## Findings
| Region  | Pre-Martial Law Avg | Post-Martial Law Avg | Percentage Change |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Korea   | 87.5                | 85.2                | -2.7%            |
| Global  | 79.7                | 77.5                | -2.8%            |

- **Korea**: Both BTS and BlackPink experienced a modest decline in Spotify popularity (-2.7%) after martial law. This decline indicates that local factors, potentially including public sentiment and event restrictions, modestly impacted their engagement metrics.
- **Global**: A slightly larger drop was observed in global popularity (-2.8%). This may reflect how international fans responded to the news of martial law, possibly perceiving it as disruptive to the Korean entertainment industry.

Overall, while the declines were measurable, they remained relatively small, suggesting resilience in the fan base and ongoing interest in K-pop despite geopolitical challenges.
